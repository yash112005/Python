#  tuple is a built in data type that let us create immutable sequence of values

# tup = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,)
# print(tup[0])
# tup[0] = 5 # assignment not allowed

# tuple = ()
# print(tuple)
# print(tup[3:5])


# tuple method
tup = (1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6)
# return index of first occurance
print(tup.index(5))
#count total occurances
print(tup.count(5))
